Geographies - OAs, LSOAs and MSOAs
==================================

The main geographies directly associated with the Census are *Output Areas* (OA) and *Super Output Areas* (SOA). OAs are the **base unit** for Census data releases. *[ONS][ons]*

Output Areas (OA)
-----------------

OAs have an average 310 residents. They are the smallest of the geographies that data is published at. They can be aggregated into Super Output Areas...

Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA)
-------------------------------------

LSOAs have an average 1,500 residents or 650 households.

Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOA)
--------------------------------------

MSOAs have an average 7,500 residents or 4000 households.

They are built from groups of contiguous LSOAs.

They all have a **usable, plain-English name** and are **within a single Local Authority**.

> MSOAs are a statistical geography created for the 2011 Census of England and Wales. There are 7,201 MSOAs in England and Wales, with a typical population of 7,000-10,000 people. Each MSOA sits within a local authority, and each local authority is divided into between one and 132 MSOAs depending on how many people live there.
